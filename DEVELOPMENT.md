# Development

Ideas I want to implement 

- File upload
- More advanced Toast
- Clean up the auth
- Endpoint for validating sessions
- API client with auth and caching
- Code input with Monaco
- Formatted text input
- Figures with image fallbacks to prevent reflowing
- Map component with [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/)
- Open graph image generation
- Toggle switch
- Resizable panels
- Carousel
- Media player


Can I remove the Python dependency and run the "tools" using Node?
