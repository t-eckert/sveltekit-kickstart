# Thomas' Site Starter

This is a starter SvelteKit set up that includes all of the tooling and configuration that I like to use when building websites. It's very specifically tuned to my needs. If you would like to make something like it your own, fork this!

## What it includes

- Tailwind 4
- Utilities
- SQLite DB for "server local DB"
- Containerfile for deployment
- Templates
- Phosphor Icons
